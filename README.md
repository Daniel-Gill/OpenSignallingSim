## OpenSignallingSim

A project aimed at simulating UK signalling systems, and allows the user to interact with signals and route trains through user created routes.

This project is inspired heavily by [Railway Operation Simulator](https://www.railwayoperationsimulator.com/) which was originally written by Albert Ball.
